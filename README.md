## 💡 The Problem
Small business owners and solo entrepreneurs struggle to create high-quality social media content. Professional photography is expensive, and writing viral captions takes time they don't have.

## 🚀 The Solution

1.  **A Professional Studio Photoshoot** (using Flux AI via Pollinations).
2.  **A Viral Instagram Caption** (using Google Gemini 1.5 Flash).
All in under 10 seconds.
